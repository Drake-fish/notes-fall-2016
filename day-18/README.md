## Review

## Challenge
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

```js
//example function calls and their expected outputs:
isIsogram( 'Dermatoglyphics' ) == true
isIsogram( 'aba' ) == false
isIsogram( 'moOse' ) == false // -- ignore letter case
```
