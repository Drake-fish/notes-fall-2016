# Day 17

## Review

## Challenge
write a function names() which takes a string of comma-separated names (first and last) and then returns an object where each last name is a key, whose value is an array with each first name as a string in it

```js
names("George Washington, Bryan Adams, John Adams, Kanye West")
  //  {
  //     Washington: ['George'],
  //     Adams: ['Bryan', John'],
  //     West, ['Kanye']
  //   }
```
