## Challenge
Revisit yesterday's challenge with a new partner!

Write a function `stairString` that takes a number as its argument and returns a string that looks like a staircase as tall as specified. Notice that the staircase is right aligned.

```js
console.log(stairString(5))
//    #
//   ##
//  ###
// ####
//#####
```
