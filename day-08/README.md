# Day 08

## Review
- Don't forget to use CSS resets (like normalize)

## Challenge
no challenge today, so much material!!

## Notes
- CSS transitions
	- anytime we want the browser to change from one property value to another, it will take a specified time to do so.

- mixin libraries / grid frameworks
	- one time only `sudo gem install bourbon`
	- every project you want to use it in:
		- got to styles folder
		- `bourbon install`
	- neat install is basically the same, but with neat instead of bourbon
- github branches
- github group project flow
